[**remark**][remark] plugin to support frontmatter (YAML, TOML, and more).

## Important!

This plugin is affected by the new parser in remark
([`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark),
see [`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
Use version 2 while you’re still on remark 12.
Use version 3 for remark 13+.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-frontmatter
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
+++
title = "New Website"
+++

# Other markdown
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var parse = require('remark-parse')
var stringify = require('remark-stringify')
var frontmatter = require('remark-frontmatter')

unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(stringify)
  .use(frontmatter, ['yaml', 'toml'])
  .use(logger)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function (err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
    console.log(String(file))
  })

function logger() {
  return console.dir
}
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```js
{
  type: 'root',
  children: [
    {type: 'toml', value: 'title = "New Website"', position: [Object]},
    {type: 'heading', depth: 1, children: [Array], position: [Object]}
  ],
  position: {
    start: {line: 1, column: 1, offset: 0},
    end: {line: 6, column: 1, offset: 48}
  }
}
```

```markdown
example.md: no issues found
+++
title = "New Website"
+++

# Other markdown
```

## API

### `remark().use(frontmatter[, options])`

Configures remark so that it can parse and serialize frontmatter (YAML, TOML,
and more).

##### `options`

See [`micromark-extension-frontmatter`][options] for a description of `options`.

## Security

Use of `remark-frontmatter` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast]) or user content so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
